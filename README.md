The Saga of Mo'Laar the Barbarian, Crusher of Candies
======

This game is my entry into the [Candy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/candyjam). It's the first game that I've designed and built entirely on my own (and the second one that I've made, period--the first being [this Breakout clone](https://github.com/jackmaney/breakout-clone) that was a part of [a PyGame course](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/game-programming-python-pygame) on Pluralsight.

Description
--------

A lonely, uprooted molar walks along a flouride-forsaken wasteland, where candies skitter to and fro. After a plea and some help from the divine, he is reborn as Mo'Larr.

Wield the mighty Hammer of Krebs as you crush all candies who dare to oppose you. You are not entirely alone, however; the goddess Andante shall lay a path of healing before you, strewn with the Toothpaste of the Divine!

Install
------

For the moment, I'm having some difficulty in getting pygame to play nicely with py2app or py2exe (I suspect that most of my troubles are in getting the right incantations to make the assets picked up in MANIFEST.in). So, for now, the only way to play the game is via the source. You'll need [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/) (or maybe 2.6, but 3 is right out; this is not Python 3 compatible, yet), along with pygame and numpy. 

If you're on Windows, you can pick them up at this handy (unofficial) site containing Windows binaries for Python modules:

* [pygame](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame)
* [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)

Otherwise, if you're on OSX or Linux, you can use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install these dependencies.
