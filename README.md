The Saga of Mo'Laar the Barbarian, Crusher of Candies
======

This game is my entry into the [Candy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/candyjam). It's the first game that I've designed and built entirely on my own (and the second one that I've made, period--the first being [this Breakout clone](https://github.com/jackmaney/breakout-clone) that was a part of [a PyGame course](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/game-programming-python-pygame) on Pluralsight.

Description
--------

A lonely, uprooted molar walks along a flouride-forsaken wasteland, where candies skitter to and fro. After a plea and some help from the divine, he is reborn as Mo'Larr.

Wield the mighty Hammer of Krebs as you crush all candies who dare to oppose you. You are not entirely alone, however; the goddess Andante shall lay a path of healing before you, strewn with the Toothpaste of the Divine!
